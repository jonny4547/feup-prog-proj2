This game takes place in a maze made up of robots and electrical fences/posts.
A electrified post is represented by an '*', a non-electrified post by an '+', the exit by 'O',
a robot by an 'R' if alive, and an 'r' if dead, and you are represented by an 'H' if alive, and an 'h' if dead.
When you touch a electrified post or a robot you die. The same rules apply to robots.
The objective of the game is to survive and get to the exits.
You can move to any of the 8 cells adjacent to your position using the following keys:
                           Q W E
                           A S D
                           Z X C
        (Where 'S' keeps you in your current position)
After you move all alive robots will move towards you without avoiding obstacles.
You may leave the game at any time by typing Ctrl-Z on Windows or Ctrl-D on Linux.
